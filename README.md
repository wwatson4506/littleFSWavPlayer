# littleFSWavPlayer
This is a littleFS version of the Teensy WavFilePlayer.

Ok this my attempt to play wav files using LittleFS. I have so far only tested with the SPI NAND memory chip using chip select 4.
It seems to work well with a buffer size of 512. I included the four test wav files in the extras folder. These are available here:

This library is just proof of functionality. WIP so to speak:)
Check the source files for more info.
